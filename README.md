# Neoserve

The solution for my homelab on serving files / links written in Golang in an attempt to learn the platform.

So far the server supports a few functions listed below

- Upload any file type.
- Max Upload Limit (Including Headers etc)
- Discord Webhooks for Upload logs.
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Scales perfectly
- Discord Webhook passthroughs (top level domain)
